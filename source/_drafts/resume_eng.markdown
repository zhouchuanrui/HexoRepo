# Project Experience

#### 2012-3~2013-1　　A Whole-view Testing System for Smart Substation

It is a distributed system to test second order devices of smart substation. The project ended by the end of 2013, and won the first prize of Sichuan science and technology improvement award.

I was in charge of whole logical design(FPGA) and bottom driver block coding(DSP), the detail are listed as follows:

1. Data caching and transmission, and the related ARM-FPGA and DSP-FPGA data/command protocols mapping out;
2. Management of time system, including time correction parameter management and time synchronization protocol implementation;
3. Control of hardware, such as SDRAM, multi-port DAC, relays of amplifier, etc;
4. Coding of FPGA and ADC interrupt function;
5. Implementation of database based of internal FLASH;
6. Implementation of fundamental wave vector calculation based of DFT.

The development tools I used includes IDEs(Quartus, CCS), simulation platforms(Matlab, Modelsim), Editors(Emacs, Vim, np++), debuggers(USB Blaster, XDS510) , etc.

#### 2009-10~2010-8　　“Freescale Cup” National Smart-car Competition	

It is a college student technology competition. My team took part in the magnetic group, we made a smart car that was able to trace a racing line loop with alternating current running through. The tools used included Code Warrior, Altium Designer, BDM debugger, etc.

And here is a list of my work:

1. PCB of magnetic sensors;
2. PCB of motor driving circuit, and digital PID speed algorithm implementation of MCU(HS12 of Freescale);
3. The human-machine interface block(LCD and key array) implementation.

# Self Assessment

I am with the character of introversion. I kept practicing hand-writing, seal cutting and playing violin since I was a kid. Yet I like playing basketball at my spare time, San Antonio Spurs is my favorite team in NBA league.

Being pretty serious and strict when working, and with a big passion in coding. And I have a huge interest in studying various kinds of software and internet tools such as Emacs, Vim, Evernote, Dropbox, git\github, org-mode, markdown, etc. I am building a personal technical site based on [Dropbox+Farbox+MathJax](layup.farbox.com) these days.
